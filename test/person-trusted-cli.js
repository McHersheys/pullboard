/**
 * Test-only entry (#408), never published: runs the shipped command with the loopback fixture relay handed in as
 * `trustedRelayOrigin`, an explicit parameter in the test's own call path. The shipped bin/pullboard.js has no such
 * switch, so outside a test the person authority comes only from the built-in relay over TLS.
 *
 * Usage: node test/person-trusted-cli.js <fixture relay origin> <pullboard arguments...>
